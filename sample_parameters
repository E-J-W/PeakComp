<---END_OF_PARAMETERS--->

This is a parameter file for the peak comparison code.  The code will analyze and compare data in the two specified .mca files, in the specified range of spectra and channels.  If you change the format of the file, prepare for unforeseen consequences.

Parameters and their descriptions follow:

EXPERIMENT_DATA
Contains the path to the .mca file containing experiment data.

ADD_BACKGROUND
no: Don't add any background.
yes: Add a linear background to the simulated data.

PLOT_OUTPUT
no: Show chisq stats only.
yes: Show a plot of the simulated and experimental data alongside chisq stats.
detailed: Same as 'yes', except plot all simulated datasets and background as well.

SAVE_OUTPUT
yes: Save fitted simulation data to mca files.  Filenames are fit_background.mca (background data), fit_simN.mca, where N is a number corresponding to each simulated data set.
no: Don't save fitted simulation data.

SIMULATED_DATA
Contains the path(s) to the .mca file(s) containing simulated data.  Multiple datasets may be specified, each on a separate line.
FIX_SCALING
no: The specified data will be fit via chisq minimization to find its scaling factor.
yes: The specified data will be scaled by the value specified under SCALING_VALUE, rather than the value obtained by chisq minimization (other scaling factors will still be determined via chisq minimization).
rel: The specified data will be scaled by the value specified under SCALING_VALUE, relative to the scaling factor of the previous dataset (if there is no previous dataset, the scaling will be set to 0).

SPECTRUM  START_CHANNEL END_CHANNEL
Contains a list of the spectra to analyze in the experiment and simulated data, along with the channel range to analyze.  Multiple spectra may be specified, each on a separate line.
