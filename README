Peak Comparison Tool
Jonathan Williams


A code for comparing peak shapes across simulated and experimental data in .mca files.  Useful for analysis of DSAM/RDM data.

A linear scaling factor will be added to the simulated data, with parameters chosen by analytically minimizing the weighted chisq goodness of fit statistic between experiment and simulation.  Multiple simulated datasets may be specified, and in this case the chisq of the sum of the datasets after scaling them individually will be minimized.  Scaling factors for a given simulated dataset may be fixed to an absolute value or a value relative to another simulated dataset's scaling factor.
If background addition is enabled in the parameter file, a linear background of form [A + B*channel] will also be added and taken into account during the chisq minimization procedure.

For a detailed example and description of how to specify parameters, see the 'sample_parameters' file.


Installation/Dependencies:
Use 'make' to compile.  Requires gcc.  Optional data plotting requires gnuplot to be installed.
To run the program from anywhere, move the resulting 'peak_comp' executable to any directory under your $PATH environment variable.
Tested and working on Ubuntu 14.04 and Scientific Linux/CentOS 6.

Outside Contributions:
This program uses linear equation solver code by K. Starosta for determining fit parameter values, and the public domain gnuplot_i library by N. Devillard for displaying plots.
